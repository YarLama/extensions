# About
This extension need for "recovery focus" on element of answer on chatgpt.com.
For one reason or another, the focus is often reset, which makes it impossible to navigate through the text using the keyboard (Arrows, PageUp/Down, Home, End).
## Keyboard shortcuts
(PageUp/PageDown) - set focus on last answer's element, which results in keyboard navigation being possible;
(Shift-ESC) - default chatgpt shortcut, set focus on chat input;
(Ctrl-/) - show all default chatgpt shortcuts;
